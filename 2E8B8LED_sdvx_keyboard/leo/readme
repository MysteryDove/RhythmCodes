# Lib Requirement
This Arduino code requires:
[ArduinoJoyStickLibrary](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary/): you need to download as zip and import into Arduino IDE.

[Bounce2](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2): you can directly download this library using arduino

# What changed
1. Button debounce implemented using Bounce2
2. RGB LED support removed because personally do not using that
3. ReportDelay changed to keep 1000hz report rate due to extra debounce cost

# Extra Notes
1. Change ReportDelay bigger to lower the report rate if you have weak cpu to save some performance
2. Change PULSE accordingly with your encoder
